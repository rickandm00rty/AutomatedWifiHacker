##Setting up our planner to handle input from the user and "read" to our program:


1. Start the script, enabling wrapper and setting WLAN interface to monitor mode (airmon-ng)

2. Using subshell '(. ./secondscript.sh)' format, start airodump-ng to capture necessary devices in area

3. Display list of AP's and MAC's for selection in Wrapper.py

4. Selecting AP starts 3rd subshell, running aireplay-Ng Deauth. Once Deauth is captured, navigate to 4th shell

5. This 4th shell is used to run the Deauth handshake through aircrack-ng and our wordlist file
